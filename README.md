## Data Engineering with Medallion Architecture using DBT, Databricks, Spark and Azure Cloud 
This is a learning project from [here](https://github.com/airscholar/modern-data-eng-dbt-databricks-azure).
In this project, we set up end-to-end data engineering using Apache Spark, Azure Databricks, and the Data Build Tool (DBT), which uses Azure as our cloud provider. 
This project illustrates data ingestion to the lakehouse, data integration with ADF, and data transformation with Databricks, and DBT.
